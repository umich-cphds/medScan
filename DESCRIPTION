Description: A collection of methods for large scale single mediator hypothesis
    testing. The six included methods for testing the mediation effect are Sobel's
    test, Max P test, joint significance test under the composite null hypothesis,
    high dimensional mediation testing, divide-aggregate composite null test,
    and Sobel's test under the composite null hypothesis. Du, J., Zhou, X., Hao, W.,

    Mediator Hypothesis Testing: Possible Choices and Comparisons."
